Software Architecture
=====================

Runtime Specification File
--------------------------

A :doc:`Component Specification File </doc/component_specification/component_specification_file>` fully describes exactly **one** function in
isolation: its signals, its parameters, and the scheduling of its own runnables. It intentionally does not know anything about the other
functions running on the same system.

A real system, however, is composed of several such functions that need to be instantiated and executed together, in a defined order, and
connected to the same middleware. The **Runtime Specification File** captures this system-level composition on top of one or more Component
Specification Files:

- **Component reference** - which Component Specification Files (i.e. which functions) are part of this runtime/system.
- **Sequencing** - the execution order across those functions, i.e. how the ``previousRunnableRef`` chains of the individual components are
  stitched together into one overall schedule.

As shown above, each ``Software Component`` (the function's business logic) is executed through its own ``Component Adapter``, which wraps it
behind the stable, middleware-independent contract defined by the meta model. The ``Runtime Scheduler`` is generated from the Runtime
Specification File and is responsible for triggering the OS-level ``Init``/``Compute``/``Terminate`` calls of every component, in the order
described by the Runtime Specification File, through the ``Middleware Abstraction Layer``.

.. note::
   The Runtime Specification File is not yet formally defined in the meta model (unlike the Component Specification File, which is defined by
   ``Eclipse-autoapiframework-Metamodel`` version 0.3.0). The concepts above describe the intended scope; a versioned schema, file extension,
   and worked examples are still to be added.

Open topics still to be worked out for the Runtime Specification File:

- Mapping of an output signal of one component to the input signal of another (data flow / connections).
- Explicit dependency declarations between components, beyond the ordering implied by ``previousRunnableRef``.
- Initialization / system setup information.
- Deployment information.
