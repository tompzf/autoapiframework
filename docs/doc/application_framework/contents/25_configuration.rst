Configuration
=============

A code-based approach in Python is used to configure applications in the
Vehicle Application Framework (VAF). By default, there are two types of
configuration levels, the foundation level (using ``vafmodel``) and the
abstraction level (using ``vafpy``). The user is encouraged to use the
abstraction level of the vafpy package, as this hides a lot of work that
needs to be done to make the internal runtime function. If more advanced
features are needed, the vafmodel API still can be used for
customization.

Abstraction level (vafpy)
-------------------------

The following section describes the classes in the vafpy package that
are used to build a VAF executable. To simplify the diagrams, only the
vafpy-based parameters are shown in the method descriptions. Each vafpy
class supports full instantiation without the use of a convenience
function. For this, the constructor supports optional vafmodel-based
parameters to instantiate the classes. To allow advanced modifications,
each vafpy object allows access to its internal vafmodel instance.

The following figure shows a simplified overview of the Configuration as
Code (CaC) architecture.

Executable
~~~~~~~~~~

Each VAF application consists of at least one executable. The executable
contains an executor that is responsible for scheduling the tasks of
added application modules. The period of the executor and the name of
the executable are set in the constructor of this class.

Application modules can be added to an executable using the
``add_application_module()`` method. The interfaces of the application
modules must be bound to an appropriate counterpart. The executable API
provides several methods to bind interfaces to supported platforms.

Application Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An application module is the entity in which the business logic is
implemented by the user. Each application module has a unique name in
its namespace and can be added to multiple executables. To communicate
with other modules, module interfaces are used. Those can be added to
the application module as either provided or consumed interfaces.
Consumed interfaces can be marked as optional, which allows the
application module to start before the a corresponding provider is
available.

Tasks are used to execute the business logic functionality. They can be
added to the application module either individually or as a task chain.
The latter ensures that the tasks are executed in a specific order.

Module Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A module interface is an interface description. It contains data
elements and operations; the name must be unique in the specified
namespace. Module interfaces can be reused across multiple application
modules. Custom datatypes for data elements and operations can be
defined using the classes in the ``vafpy.datatypes`` module.

.. image:: figures/cac-cd_module_interface.svg

Task
~~~~

Tasks defined in the CaC result in method stubs that are generated in
the application module code. Their names must be unique for each
executable. The period parameter defines the period cycle in which the
method is called. The ``referred_offset`` parameter allows the user to
specify a task order to be used when tasks have the same period.

Datatypes
~~~~~~~~~

If custom datatypes are needed in module interfaces, they can be created
in the CaC. The supported datatypes are shown in the following figure. A
``TypeRef`` is implemented as a ``using`` statement in the generated C++
code.
