Introduction
============

This project addresses application development and integration for
µP-based Electronic Control Units (ECU) in the automotive domain.

The starting point for the project is illustrated by the below stack
view on a µP-based ECU. From bottom to top, hardware gets abstracted by
an optional hypervisor but definitely by some POSIX operating system
(OS). Distributed communication is then realized an top and covered by
middleware solutions, for example based on SOME/IP or DDS. The
application layer sits on top and directly interfaces with the services
or mechanisms of the lower layer middleware respectively.

For applications that get developed according to the AUTOSAR Adaptive
standard, the middleware stack and its ara::com interface is given. The
model-driven workflow related to the solution, however, comes with
extensive front loading. All details need to be modeled, which makes it
difficult to implement agile work modes in bigger projects at the side
of an OEM or Tier-1. Architecture and modeling work is often separated
from the development teams, which makes efficient and constructive
collaboration a difficult endeavor.

Another group of applications is based on graphical engineering and
development tools. Modeling in graphical UML tools as well as
GUI-supported development (for example in MATLAB Simulink) cover the
development and test journey to a large extent. Integration with a
middleware stack below, instead, is often cumbersome and far from
straight-forward. Also tool lock-in is a problem. Applications or
algorithms that once got developed and tested in such an environment are
hard to migrate to different eco-systems. This keeps especially the
suppliers in the automotive field from reaching their goal, namely
*Software as a product*. In other words, applications that are developed
in a middleware-agnostic way and ready to be sold, no matter what
middleware stack is running in the target system.

The last application type represents code-first development. That is,
algorithms and logic that is developed irrespective of automotive
standards and independent of commercial tools. This modern approach
comes natural to engineers and computer scientists without automotive
background. Programming language skills and an IDE with helpful plugins
is all they need. When starting in automotive projects, this target
group is confronted with automotive-specific terms and APIs for
established communication patterns as for example pub-sub messaging or
remote procedure calls.

In sum, different workflows, patterns, file formats and models exist.
The complete field of application development for high-performance
machines in the automotive sector is extremely dynamic. Terms that are
used all over the place are linked with varying definitions. Even the
term *Application* has different meaning for different people, which
makes discussions on the topic troublesome and fruitless. In the end,
integration of software building blocks and especially the reuse are
complicated. Productivity decreases, integration in and migration to
series projects remains a hard task.

This situation in mind lead to the idea of an *Application Framework*
and finally to this project. The concept can be shortly summarized as
follows: Plan is to introduce a new, thin, modeled and generated layer
to the µP stack that also comes with a complete workflow and
corresponding tool to work with it. This way, lower-layer independent
design, implementation, and test of distributed applications shall
become easier and more straight-forward for either of the
above-mentioned target groups.
