# Blueprint project (IFEX + VAF)

This blueprint extends the one with VSS as provided in [bp-vss-vaf](../bp-vss-vaf/). Instead of VSS,
Interface Exchange (IFEX) is used as description and input format. 

## IFEX 
IFEX does not follow the signal-tree approach as realized by VSS. Instead, datatypes and complete
interfaces can be defined in a layered way. The representation and editing format is YAML. Please
find the corresponding IFEX file for the speed hazard detection sample application in the file
[ifex-sample-zf.yaml](./model/ifex/ifex-sample-zf.yaml).

## VAF interface project
This file is consumed as input artifact by a VAF interface project. Based on this input, the
following interfaces are defined in the Config as Code file [interfaces.py](./Interfaces/interfaces.py):
* SpeedIf
* SpeedCalculationIf
* HazardIf
* HazardDetectionIf

Finally, the complete interface definition gets exported to the VAF model format in JSON.

## Next steps
From here, the same steps apply as described for the VSS blueprint. See the corresponding
[README](../bp-vss-vaf/README.md) and [project folder](../bp-ifex-vaf/) for details. Application
module and integration can be reused from there.
