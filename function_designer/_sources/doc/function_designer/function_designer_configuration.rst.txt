Function Specification Authoring
================================

The Function Designer edits a Function Specification (``.afs``) against a
loaded Meta Model. Use the guidance below when creating or reviewing its
collections. For the complete property definitions, see the
:doc:`Meta Model reference </doc/meta_model/meta_model>` and
:doc:`Function Specification File reference </doc/function_specification/function_specification_file>`.

Signal Collection
-----------------

Add one entry to ``dataInterfaces`` for each data interface the function
consumes or produces. Set ``direction`` relative to the function: ``input``
means the function consumes the value, and ``output`` means it produces it.
Use the canonical VSS name and preserve the signal's established meaning and
datatype; do not redefine catalogue semantics for a particular function.

Describe the interface contract, including its unit, range, default,
resolution, precision, update period, accuracy, safety classification, and
protection requirement. Use ``null`` where a numeric value is not defined or
applicable. Keep runtime quality separate from static signal metadata, as
described in the Function Specification reference.

Parameter Collection
--------------------

Add function configuration and calibration values to ``parameters`` rather
than representing them as ordinary data interfaces. Reuse canonical
catalogue identifiers where available, and describe each parameter's type,
default, unit, tunability, and applicable limits. Add ``dimensions`` when the
parameter is an array or map; omit it for scalars.

.. figure:: figures/parameter_collection.png

Scheduling Collection
---------------------

Add one entry to ``scheduling`` for each independently scheduled runnable.
Use the ``<FunctionName>.Init``, ``<FunctionName>.Step``, and
``<FunctionName>.Terminate`` naming convention where those lifecycle stages
apply. Select the appropriate ``runType``; provide ``cycleTimeMs`` for cyclic
runnables, and omit it for other run types. Explain the runnable's purpose in
``description`` and set its ``implementedASIL``.

Use ``previousRunnableRef`` only when an explicit ordering constraint exists;
it does not mean that the referenced runnable must execute immediately before
this one. Each entry also declares its generic execution result as
``executionResult: {type: FunctionResult}``. The ``supervision`` object is
required for every runnable; its configuration is covered in the
Supervision section below.

Supervision
-----------

The supervision functionality allows you to monitor the execution of the function 
and detect any anomalies or errors. In the collection view it is shown as ``true`` 
or ``false`` meaning ``required`` or ``not required``.

.. figure:: figures/supervision_in_collection_window.png
   :alt: supervision in the collection window  

It can be enabled or disabled for each function, allowing you to control which 
functions are actively supervised during execution. To do this, open the ``Edit`` dialog,
there is a ``Edit Supervision`` button to configure the supervision settings.

.. figure:: figures/supervision_edit_window.png

If not required, the nodes are not available for editing.

.. figure:: figures/supervision_not_required.png
   :alt: supervision not required window

When supervision is required, select one or more supervision types. Each type
has its own configuration fields:

1. Alive Supervision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Question answered:
  "Is the runnable still running periodically?"

Checks whether a function is executed the expected number of times within a monitoring interval.

Typical use:

- Cyclic tasks
- Periodic sensor processing
- Communication handlers

2. Deadline Supervision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Question answered:
  "Was the function completed within the expected time?"

Checks whether the execution time between two checkpoints is within configured limits.

Typical use:

- Detect deadlocks
- Detect long loops
- Detect performance issues

3. Logical Supervision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Question answered:
  "Did the software follow the correct execution flow?"

Checks whether checkpoints are reached in the correct sequence.

Typical use:

- State machines
- Safety-critical control flows
- Initialization sequences

.. figure:: figures/supervision_required.png
   :alt: supervision required window

Only the settings for selected types are available for editing and written to
the specification. If no type is selected, the supervision configuration
contains no type-specific settings.

**alive:** set the minimum and maximum number of indications and the reference cycle in milliseconds.

.. figure:: figures/supervision_edit_windows.png
   :alt: supervision edit windows

**deadline:** set the minimum and maximum execution time in milliseconds.

**logical:** list the predecessor and successor references used for logical supervision. Enter multiple references as a comma-separated list.


.. list-table:: Summary
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Supervision Type
     - Checks
   * - Alive
     - Function runs the expected number of times
   * - Deadline
     - Function finishes within the allowed time
   * - Logical
     - Function follows the correct sequence of execution

Error Collection
-----------------

Use ``errorInterfaces`` for function-specific diagnostic conditions when
they are needed. Keep these distinct from ``FunctionResult``, which reports
the generic outcome of execution, and from runtime transport or adapter
failures. The Error interface is a candidate concept; see the Function
Specification reference for its current status and modeling guidance.
